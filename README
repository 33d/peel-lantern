= Introduction =

This is the firmware that will hopefully run the Peel Street Lantern.  Find
out more about the lantern here:

  http://www.hackerspace-adelaide.org.au/wiki/Peel_Street_Lantern 

= Prerequisites =

make, avrdude, gcc-avr, avr-libc.

If you're programming an Arduino, you'll also need the Arduino IDE.  Set the
environment variable ARDUINO_HOME to its path:

  export ARDUINO_HOME=/opt/arduino-0021

= Running =

To run either the master or slave on an Arduino, just run:

  make upload

This assumes the Arduino is on /dev/ttyUSB0.  You can change this:

  make UPLOAD_PORT=/dev/arduino upload

This can also be specified using an environment variable:

  export UPLOAD_PORT=/dev/buspirate
  make upload

You can use other programmers (any supported by avrdude):

  make PROGRAMMER=buspirate upload

To set the address of the slave chip (not used yet):

  make ADDR=12 setaddr

There are a few other parameters in the Makefile that you might need to change:

 - MCU_TARGET is the AVR chip you're using (see the avrdude docs)
 - UPLOAD_SPEED is the serial speed.  For the Decimilia, you need to use 19200.

The Makefile supports unit testing using cunit, which is what the TEST_OBJECTS
property is for and why the AVR files are compiled with .avr.o.  This project
doesn't have unit tests at the moment.

= Debugging =

If you're using an Arduino Mega, you can read debugging information from the
USB port:

  $ stty 500000 raw ignbrk hup < /dev/ttyUSB0 && cat /dev/ttyUSB0

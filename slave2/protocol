= Communciation protocol =

Each packet contains 97 bytes: 1 byte containing the slave ID and the row, and
96 more containing the data as sent to the TLC chips.

The slave chips do not perform any re-mapping - this must be perfomed on the
host.

Avoid sending data to the same slave chip twice in succession.  After a row is
sent, the slave takes some time loading the shift register, and it might drop
the data for that row.

== Address byte  ==

{{{  
 |   Slave ID   |    Row    | 1
  7   6   5   4   3   2   1   0
}}}
  
The slave ID is the 4 bit slave number.  The row is the row number, as sent
to the shift register.  The lowest bit is always 1.

== Data ==

The data is 96 bytes, exactly as sent to the TLCs, so the bit most distant
from the harvester board is sent first.  You must send data for all 16 lines
on each TLC, even though we only use 12.

The lowest bit of each byte must be 0.  The data are not shifted; we simply
lose any values that may have a 1 in that position.  This means we lose one
bit for even rows and two for odd rows.  Since odd rows lose their 4th bit, 
this might be noticeable; we'll have to try it and see.

= Errors =

Errors are reported using the status LED on the Arduinos.  The LED will flash
a number of times, followed by a longer delay.  After this happens 10 times,
the board resets.

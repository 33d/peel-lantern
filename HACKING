I'll assume all submitted patches are in the public domain.

I'm using the coding style that the Eclipse CDT uses by default (indent with
tabs, open brackets on the same line etc; but I'm not that fussy as long as
the indenting is consistent).  I could include the Eclipse project files if
they'll be useful to anyone.
